<h1 align='center'>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h3 align='center'>I'm Ryan, a first-year SWE student from the land down under ðŸ¦˜</h4>

### ðŸ”­ What am I working on?
I'm currently working with Ovio, a non-profit looking to bring wider engagement to the world of Open Source. With my time there, I currently work on Aqualink, an open source coral monitoring application, and their open source discovery platform.

I'm also the Lead Developer for 50 Raw, an e-learning start-up looking to bring the latest and greatest in tech to thousands of high-school students across Victoria. We hope to build a youth educational platform like no other, and challenge what is possible with e-learning :rocket:

I also love to work on small projects on the side such as react-ui-gradient (an upcoming open-source gradient component!), and participate at hackathons and coding comps!

### ðŸ’» Why do I code?
I code to make a difference.

### ðŸ’¬ What could I talk with you about?
Anything academic really! I love to keep myself up to date with all that happens in the science and tech world, including physics and mathematics. 

### âš¡ What's a fun fact about me?
I love to take and edit photos in my free time! You are free to check out some of my work on Instagram.
